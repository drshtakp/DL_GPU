Group D mixed note:

1. The website is really well organized and we can almost find everything, however, they should change their Twitter logo to X logo.
2. It might be nice that the research and publication include highlights of what paper to look into (recent findings).
3. Special Projects are 'experiments or investigations of a scientific or technical nature, undertaken by one or more Member States, likely to be of interest to the general scientific community'. Users within one of ECMWF's Member States may apply for resources as a 'Special Project'.
4. Did not find any climate change section in the research sections
5. What is climate reanalysis? They have provided a brief derscription.
