1. Re-analyzed and historical Datasets - ERA-5 reanalysis is available and subsets of it in terms of specific variables and time spans and spatial coverage. ECMWF also publishes data sets that are prepared for specific experiments
3. AIFS vs IFS - IFS is a global calculation of many more climatic variables and their interaction, ML models can make specific predictions of certain variables over time. The breadth of IFS is more comprehensive than models trained for specific tasks/variable forecasting, even if they have comparable forecasting accuracy.
4. Live forecast datasets - can be used as inputs into other models that depend on weather forecast scenarios (local ecosystem dynamics, socioeconomic impacts)
