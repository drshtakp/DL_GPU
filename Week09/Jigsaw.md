Jigsaw Activity: Exploring the ECMWF Website for Non-Meteorologists

**Objective:** Through collaborative group work, explore different sections of the ECMWF website and formulate relevant questions to enhance understanding.

**Setup:**

- Group A: Website Navigation & Homepage Features
- Group B: Accessing Weather Data
- Group C: Forecast Tools and Resources
- Group D: Research & Publications
- Sub-task Groups: Each main group can be further divided into sub-task groups.

**Activity Steps:**

*1. Initial Group Exploration (10 minutes):*

Each main group explores its designated section of the ECMWF website.
Each person identify a topic and focus on understanding and extracting the main points of each topic.

*2. Formulation of Questions (5 minutes):*

After exploring, each group should create two questions related to each topic. Write these topics and questions in your respective Group-first-draft.mdf file.
The questions should be something you genuinely want to know or feel would benefit the larger class.

*3. Jigsaw Shuffle (5 minutes):*

One representative from each group joins together to form a mixed group. There should now be mixed groups, each with a representative from Group A, B, C, and D.
Representatives share their ONE topic's main points and the questions they formulated.

*4. Discussion and Clarification (10 minutes):*

In their mixed groups, participants should help answer each other's questions based on what they've learned.
If there are questions they can't answer, they should highlight them for the instructor and make notes in their respective Group-mixed.md file.

*5. Class Discussion (10 minutes):*

Mixed groups share, using their Group-mixed.md file, a summary of their discussions with the whole class.
Highlighted questions are presented to the instructor for clarification.
Instructor addresses the questions, providing insights and further information.

*6. Reflection (5 minutes):*

Reflect on what they've learned and how the jigsaw activity helped them understand the ECMWF website better.
They can share any additional insights or takeaways from the activity.
Finalize the Group-mixed.md file.
