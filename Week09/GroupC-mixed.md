Questions for each Topic:Using NVIDIA's FourCastNet, Huawei's Pangu-Weather, Googles GraphCast, how are each different?FourCastNet recent update? https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/aifs-blog/2023/ECMWF-unveils-alpha-version-of-new-ML-modelpredictable variables vary, not all predict precipitation

Training?

Software?

How important is bit-reproducibility at the hardware and software level? This question is raised in the context of the ECMWF Scalability Workshop, which discusses the importance of reproducibility in weather prediction and climate science applications

Should the emphasis be on compiler rather than hardware co-design?


Topics: Accessing Datasets

Dataset vs model?

Questions for each Topic: ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), how much time will the atmospheric simulation take to run on these reanalysis datasets? What is meant by 15-member coupled IFS (cycle 43R1) extended-range reforecast?


NEW MIXED QUESTIONS

Why does the data sets have models inside the data itself?
Are the APIs actually open to the public?
Are the variable names universal?
What kind of fields in Atmospheric Science actually utilize the whole data sets.
